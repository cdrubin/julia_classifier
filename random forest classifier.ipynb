    "Our goal when building a classifier is to choose ways to split the data that will result in the largest reduction in entropy. One way of thinking of this is straightforward - choose criteria to divide the set in the way that best seperates attributes. This kind of choice corresponds to the largest information $ I $ increase which put another way is the largest decrease in entropy."
